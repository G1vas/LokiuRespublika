# LokiuRespublika
A website with basic Backend functionality. Inspired by LOKIS and Respublika theatrical performances.

All images, the video, and the background special effect belong to their respective owners. This project was made as my final exam during my Full Stack course. I chose to incorporate more of Frontend (the design, the video, the moving background) because I already did a project in my university, where I made a terrible design, but I did a lot more of Backend things - user registration, login, security checks, secure password storing and so on. During this project, I wanted to make something I would like to use and wouldn't be ashamed of showing to someone. In any case, if a site has a terrible user interface/design, no one is even going to use it. So I tried to make at least somewhat appealing :)
